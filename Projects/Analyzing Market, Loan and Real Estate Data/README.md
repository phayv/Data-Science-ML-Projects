# Analyzing Market Data Series
In this series, I will analyze market data. This ranges from Real Estate Investing to Stocks. Then because I was doing Real Estate, I wanted a project that would be a pipeline for predicting loan approval since people take out loans for houses. 

These projects are in R and Python Notebooks and use:
- Regression (duh, but different types)
- ETC.
