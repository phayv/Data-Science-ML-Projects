# Rating Your Movie Before You Make It!

1. This is a Python Script that will rate your movie within a given GENRE, Language, and Country before you make it. (Maybe Budget Too... This is because independent films and lesser known films might have a higher score, but not generally the case.)

This will tell you what actors are more correlated with liked movies. You can feed it a movie title and other features to let you know what your IMDB score will be.  

This combines the use of  
- Natural Language Processing 
- Sentiment Analysis
- Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Etc.

Here is the process I have in mind:  

From Part 0: Analyzing Twitter Sentiment with NLTK  
- Find out happiness sentiment of Twitter
- Get insight to how people feel in general and specific times of the year to see if it affects what movies people like to see.

From Part 1: Analyzing Best Type of Movies  
- Find out best features for overall high IMDB score.
- Create dataset of reviews of movies from IMDB with those top features and specific genre(s).
- Perform Text Mining on review dataset to find key elements that reviewers liked for in movies. 

From Part 2: NOT YET THERE  
- Add key elements data to movie data, train and make a model (probably NB?)

From Part 3: NOT YET THERE
-
