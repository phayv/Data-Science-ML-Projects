# Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis on Tweets About Airlines
I did the project all on one notebook, so it is probably fairly big.  
This project was done in R 

Here are some conclusions:
- Most tweets have negative sentiment (>60%) and most are from the US.
- Most tweets are targeted towards United airlines, then American and US Airways.
- Virgin receives very few tweets.
- Main reasons for negative sentiment are Customer Service Issues and Late Flights.
- Negative sentiment tweets towards Delta are based mostly on late flights and not so much on Customer Service Issues as for the rest of the airlines.
- The flight is almost never the issue with customers and damaged luggage is rare.
