# Rating Your Movie Before You Make It!

1. This is a Python Script that will rate your movie within a given GENRE, Language, and Country before you make it. (Maybe Budget Too... This is because independent films and lesser known films might have a higher score, but not generally the case.)

This will tell you what actors are more correlated with liked movies. You can feed it a movie title and other features to let you know what your IMDB score will be.  

This combines the use of  
- Natural Language Processing 
- Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Etc.
